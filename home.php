    <p class="card-text">At SMA Plus PGRI Cibinong, <i>Student Day</i> is always an exciting opportunity for students to explore new skills and broaden their horizons. One of the most anticipated activities this year is the <b>Web Programming</b> workshop, designed to introduce students to the world of website development.
During the session, participants learn the basics of web programming, including HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. With hands-on guidance from experienced mentors, students get to create their own simple web pages and understand how websites are built from scratch. The atmosphere is energetic and collaborative, as students share ideas and help each other overcome challenges.
This event not only develops technical skills but also encourages creativity and problem-solving. By the end of the workshop, students feel more confident about their ability to design and build web pages, opening up new possibilities for future learning and projects.
Student Day: Web Programming is a great step toward preparing students for the digital era. It inspires them to continue exploring technology and perhaps even pursue careers in web development or related fields.</p>
